## üõ†Ô∏è Build Tool

This project includes a **GNU Make** build tool to automate Flutter commands across all projects.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed and configured
- GNU Make (usually pre-installed on macOS/Linux)

### Quick Start

```bash
# See all available commands
make help

# Run all commands for all projects
make all

# Check Flutter installation across all projects
make doctor
```

### Available Make Targets

#### Main Targets
- `make all` - Run all commands for all projects
- `make doctor` - Run `flutter doctor -v` for all projects
- `make pub-get` - Get dependencies for all projects
- `make analyze` - Analyze all projects
- `make test` - Run tests for all projects
- `make build-android` - Build Android APK for all projects
- `make build-ios` - Build iOS for all projects (debug, no codesign)
- `make clean` - Clean all projects

#### Individual Project Targets
- `make hello-flutter` - Run all commands for HelloFlutter project
- `make project-01` - Run all commands for 01-Flutter-Widgets
- `make project-02` - Run all commands for 02-Flutter-UI-Components
- `make project-03` - Run all commands for 03-Flutter-Design-Animations
- `make project-04` - Run all commands for 04-Flutter-Forms-Gestures

- `make project-06` - Run all commands for 06-Flutter-Accessing-Device
- `make project-07` - Run all commands for 07-Flutter-Advanced-Concepts

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Check Flutter installation and dependencies
make doctor

# Get dependencies for all projects
make pub-get

# Analyze code quality across all projects
make analyze

# Run tests for all projects
make test

# Build Android APKs for all projects
make build-android

# Build iOS apps for all projects (debug mode)
make build-ios

# Run all commands for a specific project
make project-01

# Clean all build artifacts
make clean
```

### What Each Command Does

1. **`flutter doctor -v`** - Checks Flutter installation and dependencies
2. **`flutter pub get`** - Downloads and installs project dependencies
3. **`flutter analyze`** - Performs static analysis and linting
4. **`flutter test`** - Runs unit and widget tests
5. **`flutter build apk --release`** - Builds optimized Android APK
6. **`flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign`** - Builds iOS app in debug mode without code signing

### Features

- üé® **Colored output** - Easy to read with color-coded messages
- üìÅ **Automatic navigation** - Changes to each project directory automatically
- ‚ö° **Parallel processing** - Efficient execution across multiple projects
- üîÑ **Error handling** - Continues to next project if one fails
- üìã **Help system** - Comprehensive help with `make help`

## üöÄ Getting Started
