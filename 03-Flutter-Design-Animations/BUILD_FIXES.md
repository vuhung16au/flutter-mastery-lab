# Build Fixes Applied

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve build issues for Project 3: Flutter Design & Animations.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. iOS Build Error: Missing Font Files

**Problem**: The app was trying to reference custom font files that didn't exist:
```
Error: unable to locate asset entry in pubspec.yaml: "assets/fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf"
```

**Solution**: Commented out the custom font references in `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
# Custom fonts (commented out until font files are added)
# fonts:
#   - family: CustomFont
#     fonts:
#       - asset: assets/fonts/CustomFont-Regular.ttf
#       - asset: assets/fonts/CustomFont-Bold.ttf
#         weight: 700
```

### 2. Android Build Error: NDK Version Conflicts

**Problem**: The `rive` package was causing NDK version conflicts:
```
Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- path_provider_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- rive_common requires Android NDK 25.1.8937393
```

**Solution**: 
1. **Removed the `rive` package** from dependencies to avoid NDK conflicts
2. **Updated Android NDK version** in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:
   ```kotlin
   android {
       ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
   }
   ```
3. **Updated the Rive animation section** to show a placeholder instead of actual Rive integration

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:

1. **`pubspec.yaml`**
   - Commented out custom font references
   - Removed `rive: ^0.12.4` dependency

2. **`android/app/build.gradle.kts`**
   - Updated NDK version to `27.0.12077973`

3. **`lib/main.dart`**
   - Updated Rive animation section to show placeholder
   - Removed unused imports

4. **Documentation files**
   - Updated README files to reflect the changes
   - Added notes about Rive package being optional

## Current Status

✅ **iOS Build**: Fixed - No more font file errors  
✅ **Android Build**: Fixed - No more NDK conflicts  
✅ **Code Analysis**: Clean - No analyzer issues  
✅ **Debug APK**: Successfully builds  

## How to Add Custom Fonts Later

1. Add font files to `assets/fonts/` directory
2. Uncomment the fonts section in `pubspec.yaml`
3. Update font file paths to match actual files

## How to Add Rive Animations Later

1. Add the rive package back to `pubspec.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   rive: ^0.12.4
   ```
2. Ensure Android NDK version is compatible
3. Add Rive files to `assets/animations/` directory
4. Update the Rive animation section in `lib/main.dart`

## Testing

The app now builds successfully on both platforms:
- iOS: `flutter run -d iPhone`
- Android: `flutter run -d emulator-5554`
- Debug APK: `flutter build apk --debug`

All 17 animation and design components are functional except for the Rive animation which shows a placeholder.
