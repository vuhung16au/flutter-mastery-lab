## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```dart
import 'package:your_app/animations/index.dart';

// Navigate to the animation gallery
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const AnimationGallery(),
  ),
);
```

### Individual Animations
```dart
// Use specific animation screens
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) => const BasicAnimations(),
  ),
);
```

### Programmatic Access
```dart
// Access demo list programmatically
for (final demo in AnimationDemos.demos) {
  print('${demo.title}: ${demo.description}');
}
```
