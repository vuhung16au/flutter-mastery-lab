## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Test camera functionality on a physical device
2. Verify gallery access with different image types
3. Test notification scheduling and display
4. Verify orientation changes work correctly

### Automated Testing
```bash
flutter test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Camera not working**: Ensure camera permissions are granted
2. **Gallery access denied**: Check storage permissions
3. **Notifications not showing**: Verify notification permissions
4. **Orientation not changing**: Check device auto-rotate settings

### Debug Tips

- Use `flutter doctor` to check Flutter installation
- Check device logs for permission-related errors
- Test on different Android/iOS versions
- Verify manifest file configurations
